Viridian Forest not only has trees\nstanding like a maze but also has many\fups and downs.\rThat’s why people get lost easily here.
Oh, hold up there! The forest is\ncurrently under police lockdown.\rYou’ll have to come back later.
Oh, you have the Earth Badge...\rYou can go through, but be careful.\nThe Pokémon in there have gotten\freally rough!
