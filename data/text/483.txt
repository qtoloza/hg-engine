You’ve started to collect Kanto\nGym Badges?\rDon’t you agree that the Trainers\nhere are tough?
I guess you’ll be finished with your\nconquest of Kanto Gyms soon.\rLet me know if you get all\neight Badges.
Congratulations!\nYou got all the Kanto Gym Badges.\rI’ve got a reward for your efforts.\r

LATIAS is a Pokémon that travels\na great distance.\rIt’ll be difficult to find without any\nmachine to track it with.\rBut any Trainer will be drawn to it,\nwon’t they?\r

Steven: While in the Kanto region, I’ve\nbeen staying in a house in Pewter City.\fYou should come visit, if you have time!\fParticularly if you happen to find that\fPokémon I just mentioned...\rMay our journeys cross again!\r
Are you looking to challenge the\nVermilion Gym?\rSorry, but our Gym Leader is\ncurrently absent.\rWhy not check out the gyms in\nPewter and Cerulean City?
Say, isn’t that a Machine Part\nfrom the Power Plant?\nShouldn’t you return it?
