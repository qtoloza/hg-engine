Welcome to Fast Ship S.S. Aqua.\r...Except that the engine-maintenance\nteam is taking some time off, and we\fdon’t know when we can depart...
Welcome to Fast Ship S.S. Aqua.\nMay I see your S.S. Ticket?\r
{STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0} tried to show the\nS.S. Ticket...\r...But no Ticket here!\r
I’m sorry...\rAnother person without a Ticket\nwouldn’t make much of a difference,\fI think.\rBut a rule is a rule.\nSorry, kiddo.
{STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0} flashed the S.S. Ticket.\r
OK, you have a Ticket!\rWe’re departing soon.\nGet on board quick!\r
What?\nYou already showed me the Ticket.
Welcome to the S.S. Aqua!\rYour Ticket is...right there.\nPlease come through.\r
Operating a ship every day can wear\nyou out!\fIt’s not running today.\rIt leaves for Vermilion City on Mondays\nand Fridays!

Professor Oak: Now where did I put it...\nAh, here it is!\r
Professor Oak: It’s up to you to find\nout what that item actually does!\rPerhaps if you happen to know any\narchaeologists, they can help...\r
Oh, time flies!\rI have a radio show to record\nat Goldenrod Radio Tower.\rYou must be heading for Kanto.\rIf you come near Pallet Town, do drop\nby my Pokémon Research Lab!\r
The S.S. Aqua uses jets to travel.\nIt skims over water!
You’ve been to Kanto already?\rI hear many rare Pokémon live\nover there.\rSounds exciting.\nI’d love to visit!
