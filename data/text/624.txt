What’s this? Team Rocket has\ncome back?\rI saw some men in black at the\nLake of Rage.
I stop my Pokémon from evolving too\nearly.\rI make them learn certain moves before\nI let them evolve.
Pokémon do become stronger when they\nevolve, but they also learn moves\fmore slowly.
POLIWHIRL: Whialop!
Young man, you should treat your\nPokémon in a manner fit for a king!\rMaybe this little accessory will\nallow you to do so!\r
Young lass, you should treat your\nPokémon in a manner fit for a king!\rMaybe this little accessory will\nallow you to do so!\r
A King’s Rock will give your Pokémon\nregal beauty!\rAlthough, I have also heard allowing\nthe crown to touch certain Pokémon\fcan cause instantaneous evolution...
