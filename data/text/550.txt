You’re a rookie trainer, right? Let me\nshow you around! Follow me!\r
Oh, please, let me show you around.\nIt won’t take long, I promise!\r
This is a Pokémon Center. They heal\nyour Pokémon in no time at all.\r
This is a Pokémon Mart.\nThey sell Poké Balls for catching wild\fPokémon and other useful items.\r
Route 30 is out this way.\rTrainers will be battling their\nPokémon there.\rIf you go a little farther,\nyou’ll see Mr. Pokémon’s House.\r
This is the sea, as you can see.\rSome Pokémon are found only in water.\r
And here is my house! As a reward for\nfollowing me, take this Old Rod!\r
{STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0} received\nthe Running Shoes from the Guide Gent!
Simply toss that rod into water, and\nyou have a chance of getting a bite.\r
...Hffp... Hffp...\nI made it...\rI forgot about one thing.\nThis is another token from me!\rTake it.\r
The Guide Gent loaded the Map Card\non {STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0}’s Pokégear!
{STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0}’s Pokégear\ncan now show the Town Map!\r
Select the Pokégear on the\nTouch Screen and then select\fthe Town Map icon.\rYou’ll see the map of the region\nyou’re currently in!\rThe Pokégear becomes more useful as\nyou add Cards.\rI wish you luck on your journey!\r
...\rYou got a Pokémon at the Lab.\nWhat a waste.\rThat’s a Pokémon that’s too good for\na wimp like you.\r...\nDon’t you get what I’m saying?\rWell, I too have a good Pokémon.\nI’ll show you what I mean!\r
...\rDo you want to know who I am?\n...\rI’m going to be the world’s greatest\nPokémon Trainer.\r
Give it back!\nThat’s my Trainer Card!\rOh no!\nYou saw my name...\r
Did you talk to the old man by the\nPokémon Center?\rHe’ll put a Map of Johto on your\nPokégear.
When you’re with Pokémon,\ngoing anywhere is fun.
Mr. Pokémon’s house is still farther\nup ahead.\rYou could use the Running Shoes if\nyou had a pair.\rBut beware of wild Pokémon and\nTrainers!\rWhen you run, the noise will\nattract them.
I battled the Trainers on the road.\nMy Pokémon lost.\rThey’re a mess! I must take them to\na Pokémon Center.
A Pokémon I caught had an item.\nI think it’s Mystic Water.\rI don’t need it, so do you want it?\r
Back to fishing for me, then.
You don’t have room for this.
Cherrygrove City\nThe City of Fragrant Flowers
Guide Gent’s House\nFull-of-Energy, High-Speed Old Man
Actually, I’d like to give you one\nmore thing. Something very special.\r
{STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0} received an Egg from the\nGuide Gent!\r
Keep it in your party and it should\neventually hatch. Good luck!\r
