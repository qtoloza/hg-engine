Welcome. This is Silph Co.’s\nhead office building.
Hey, you! The elevator there is out of\norder now.\rSomething is wrong with the electricity,\nand it won’t work right.\rI feel sorry that you wasted a trip,\nso here is a gift for you!\r
It’s Silph Co.’s latest product.\nIt’s not for sale anywhere yet.
This elevator is out of order.\rIt may electrocute you. Stay away.



Steven: We meet again!\nHave you been to Hoenn before?\rIt’s such a beautiful place, with the\nclearest ocean you can imagine.\rYou should visit sometime.\fHey!\rWhy don’t we trade Pokémon?\rI’ve been looking for FORRETRESS.\nI can trade my BELDUM for it. {YESNO 0}
Steven: Will you trade FORRETRESS\nfor my BELDUM? {YESNO 0}
Steven: OK, let’s trade!\r
Steven: That’s too bad.
Steven: Are you telling me that\nyou think that’s a FORRETRESS?
Steven: You don’t see FORRETRESS in\nthe Hoenn region.\rIt’s my first time to actually see one.\nThank you so much!\rOh, look at the time. I really must go.\r
Steven: This Pokémon seems to like\nyou a lot. Do you happen to like\fSteel-type Pokémon?\rI had a feeling.\nThat particular texture!\rThe cool and glowing bodies!\nSuch uniquenesses are only for\fSteel-type Pokémon!\rWhen it comes to the solitariness and\nnobleness you sense through the \frugged body, which is almost rebuffing\fwhen you hug, nothing comes close to\fBELDUM, I must say...\rIn short, my METAGROSS is\ntruly strong and cool!\r...\nOh, it seems that I got carried away.\rIt was a pleasure talking to you.\nBye!\r
Hello...\nYou’re breaking up...\fI think it depends on how my dad feels.\rI see...\nI’ll be on my way. See you soon.\r
Steven: Oh, hello again!\nYou know, I remember your eyes.\rWhen I see a Trainer whose eyes\ntwinkle, I always remember!\r
Steven: You have a Pokédex, don’t you?\nSo you are also in search of Pokémon.\fLet me see...\rI think I can help you with that.\rLet’s say that you have stones in\nfront of you.\fWhich color would you pick? {YESNO 0}
Green Stone
Red Stone
Blue Stone
Steven: For choosing that stone...\nI will give you {STRVAR_1 0, 1, 0}!\r
{STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0} received\nthe {STRVAR_1 0, 1, 0} from Steven!
Steven: Take good care of it.\nYour caring for it will make me\fvery happy.\rBy-the-by, you should visit my house\nin Pewter City.\rPerhaps we can even battle!\r
Steven: I see...\nFor the choice you’ve made,\fI’d like to give you this Pokémon.\rExcept your party is full.\rWhy don’t you go to the PC to make\nsome room? I’ll be waiting here.
Steven: I will ask again.\nWhich color do you choose? {YESNO 0}
Would you like to give a nickname\nto {STRVAR_1 0, 1, 0}? {YESNO 0}
Steven: You did a great job naming it!\r
QUIT
Steven: You seem to be quite cautious.\rAre you avoiding any chance when a\nperson might trick you?\fYou really are better than I thought.


Professor Elm: Oh, {STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0}! I bet you\nweren’t expecting to see me here,\fright?\rI was actually looking for you, since I\nheard you were collecting Gym Badges\fin Kanto.\rIt’s a bit belated, but for being known\nas Champion {STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0}, I’d like to give\fyou the other two Pokémon that you\fdidn’t choose so long ago.\rDon’t worry, they’re only rare,\nnot endangered!\r
I hate to say it, but the Pokémon\nbehind you isn’t what I was looking for!
That is indeed one of the starters\ngiven out by Rowan in Sinnoh!\rSo you own a {COLOR 1}{STRVAR_1 0, 1, 0}{COLOR 0}...\rIn that case, I’d like you to have\nthese two Pokémon!\r
{STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0} received {COLOR 2}CYNDAQUIL{COLOR 0} and {COLOR 2}TOTODILE{COLOR 0}\nfrom Professor Elm!
{STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0} received {COLOR 2}CHIKORITA{COLOR 0} and {COLOR 2}TOTODILE{COLOR 0}\nfrom Professor Elm!
{STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0} received {COLOR 2}CHIKORITA{COLOR 0} and {COLOR 2}CYNDAQUIL{COLOR 0}\nfrom Professor Elm!
Professor Elm: I’ll be returning to\nNew Bark Town, then.\rSee you around, {STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0}!
But... your party is too full.\nCome and see me again another\ftime, please!

Welcome. This is Silph Co.’s\nhead office building.\rOh, you’re a trainer? The top\nfloor has been off-limits lately.\fSomething about old equipment\nmalfunctioning... strange noises\fcoming from the storage room.\rThe scientists seem nervous\nabout it, but I’m sure it’s nothing.\r
Welcome. This is Silph Co.’s\nhead office building.\rThings have been much calmer\naround here lately.\fThe scientists finally stopped\nworrying about the storage room.\r
