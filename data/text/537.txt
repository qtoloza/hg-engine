Welcome. This is Silph Co.’s\nhead office building.
Hey, you! The elevator there is out of\norder now.\rSomething is wrong with the electricity,\nand it won’t work right.\rI feel sorry that you wasted a trip,\nso here is a gift for you!\r
It’s Silph Co.’s latest product.\nIt’s not for sale anywhere yet.
This elevator is out of order.\rIt may electrocute you. Stay away.



Steven: We meet again!\nHave you been to Hoenn before?\rIt’s such a beautiful place, with the\nclearest ocean you can imagine.\rYou should visit sometime.\fHey!\rWhy don’t we trade Pokémon?\rI’ve been looking for FORRETRESS.\nI can trade my BELDUM for it. {YESNO 0}
Steven: Will you trade FORRETRESS\nfor my BELDUM? {YESNO 0}
Steven: OK, let’s trade!\r
Steven: That’s too bad.
Steven: Are you telling me that\nyou think that’s a FORRETRESS?
Steven: You don’t see FORRETRESS in\nthe Hoenn region.\rIt’s my first time to actually see one.\nThank you so much!\rOh, look at the time. I really must go.\r
Steven: This Pokémon seems to like\nyou a lot. Do you happen to like\fSteel-type Pokémon?\rI had a feeling.\nThat particular texture!\rThe cool and glowing bodies!\nSuch uniquenesses are only for\fSteel-type Pokémon!\rWhen it comes to the solitariness and\nnobleness you sense through the \frugged body, which is almost rebuffing\fwhen you hug, nothing comes close to\fBELDUM, I must say...\rIn short, my METAGROSS is\ntruly strong and cool!\r...\nOh, it seems that I got carried away.\rIt was a pleasure talking to you.\nBye!\r
Hello...\nYou’re breaking up...\fI think it depends on how my dad feels.\rI see...\nI’ll be on my way. See you soon.\r
Steven: Oh, hello again!\nYou know, I remember your eyes.\rWhen I see a Trainer whose eyes\ntwinkle, I always remember!\r
Steven: You have a Pokédex, don’t you?\nSo you are also in search of Pokémon.\fLet me see...\rI think I can help you with that.\rLet’s say that you have stones in\nfront of you.\fWhich color would you pick? {YESNO 0}
Green Stone
Red Stone
Blue Stone
Steven: For choosing that stone...\nI will give you {STRVAR_1 0, 1, 0}!\r
{STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0} received\nthe {STRVAR_1 0, 1, 0} from Steven!
Steven: Take good care of it.\nYour caring for it will make me\fvery happy.\rBy-the-by, you should visit my house\nin Pewter City.\rPerhaps we can even battle!\r
Steven: I see...\nFor the choice you’ve made,\fI’d like to give you this Pokémon.\rExcept your party is full.\rWhy don’t you go to the PC to make\nsome room? I’ll be waiting here.
Steven: I will ask again.\nWhich color do you choose? {YESNO 0}
Would you like to give a nickname\nto {STRVAR_1 0, 1, 0}? {YESNO 0}
Steven: You did a great job naming it!\r
QUIT
Steven: You seem to be quite cautious.\rAre you avoiding any chance when a\nperson might trick you?\fYou really are better than I thought.


Professor Elm: Oh, {STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0}! I bet you\nweren’t expecting to see me here,\fright?\rI was actually looking for you, since I\nheard you were collecting Gym Badges\fin Kanto.\rIt’s a bit belated, but for being known\nas Champion {STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0}, I’d like to give\fyou the other two Pokémon that you\fdidn’t choose so long ago.\rDon’t worry, they’re only rare,\nnot endangered!\r
I hate to say it, but the Pokémon\nbehind you isn’t what I was looking for!
That is indeed one of the starters\ngiven out by Rowan in Sinnoh!\rSo you own a {COLOR 1}{STRVAR_1 0, 1, 0}{COLOR 0}...\rIn that case, I’d like you to have\nthese two Pokémon!\r
{STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0} received {COLOR 2}CYNDAQUIL{COLOR 0} and {COLOR 2}TOTODILE{COLOR 0}\nfrom Professor Elm!
{STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0} received {COLOR 2}CHIKORITA{COLOR 0} and {COLOR 2}TOTODILE{COLOR 0}\nfrom Professor Elm!
{STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0} received {COLOR 2}CHIKORITA{COLOR 0} and {COLOR 2}CYNDAQUIL{COLOR 0}\nfrom Professor Elm!
Professor Elm: I’ll be returning to\nNew Bark Town, then.\rSee you around, {STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0}!
But... your party is too full.\nCome and see me again another\ftime, please!
