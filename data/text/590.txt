Cheryl: Oh, hello, {STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0}!\nIt’s nice to see you again when\fwe aren’t in a time of crisis.\rPerhaps you’d be interested in a\nbit of trading?\rI’ve got a CHANSEY I’d be willing\nto trade with you.\rHave you got a MUNCHLAX? {YESNO 0}
Thank you for trading with me.\nI always wanted to try raising\fa SNORLAX.
Hmm? I don’t think that’s a\nMUNCHLAX, {STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0}...
You don’t want to trade?\nWell, that’s a shame.
It amazes me just how much MUNCHLAX\neats. It’s expensive, but I wouldn’t\fgive it up for the world!\rBut enough about my end,\nhow is CHANSEY doing?
Mira: Hey, {STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0}! We should have\na battle when we get stronger!
Marley: Oh... {STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0}...\nIt’s good to see you are well...\rWe should battle at some point...\nI’d like that...\rJust a bit...
Mira: Ohh! Mira has been waiting\nfor you to show up!\rMira wants to know if\nyou’d like to battle! {YESNO 0}
You don’t want to?\nMira is disappointed...
Mira found that fun. Mira wonders if\nshe can get stronger...
Mira will show {STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0} how strong\nshe has gotten!\r
Marley: Hello...\nWe’ve both grown quite strong...\rMight you...\nWish to battle me? {YESNO 0}
Oh... You can be that mean?
Excellent... Let’s get started...\r
That was enjoyable... I like battling with you...\rJust a tiny bit.
Cheryl: I hope my CHANSEY is\ndoing well with you, {STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0}!\rIn the meanwhile, would you\nlike to have a battle? {YESNO 0}
I guess Pokémon aren’t always\nable to fight, right?
Giggle... This should be fun!\rBut let me warn you, my Pokémon\ncan be quite rambunctious!\r
Being a Trainer isn’t easy. The more\nyou battle, the more you discover.\rBut being a Trainer is very rewarding,\nwouldn’t you say?
After the conclusion of the trade, a\nmysterious sphere appeared in midair...\r
