That red Gyarados wasn’t acting right.\nAs I feared, somebody must have forced\fit to evolve...\r

Lance: Excellent!\rIt seems that the Lake of Rage’s\nMagikarp are being forced to evolve.\rA mysterious radio broadcast coming\nfrom Mahogany is probably the cause.\rAnd that suspicious souvenir shop...\rI’ll be waiting for you in Mahogany,\n{STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0}.

The Gyarados are angry!\nIt’s a bad omen!
Hahah! The Magikarp are biting!
I heard this lake was made by rampaging\nGyarados.\rI wonder if there is any connection\nto their mass outbreak now?
Did my eyes deceive me? I saw a \nred Gyarados in the Lake of Rage...\rBut I thought Gyarados were\nusually blue?
Pryce: The strong rain falling on the\nsurface seems to be agitating the\fraging lake.\rThis must have some purpose that we\nmeet again.\rWhy don’t we exchange our phone\nnumbers? {YESNO 0}\n

When you spot a Trainer, it’s time for\na challenge!\fThat’s the way of Trainers!
                
                                        
What happened to the red Gyarados?\rIt’s gone?\nI came all the way for it...\rOK, I challenge you!
