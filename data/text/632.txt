Have you ever seen Clair’s signature\nPokémon? It’s a wonder to marvel at!\rI’d love for my HORSEA to match that\nPokémon, but it isn’t strong enough...\rSay, you’re a Trainer, right? You might\nfind this item more useful than me.\r
There was this move I just had\nto teach my Pokémon.\rSo I got the Move Deleter to make it\nforget an HM move.
They say that the Pokémon Mart here\ngot ahold of a large shipment of rare\fevolution stones.
That item is said to do something if\nused on a Seadra...
Evolution is so cool!\nIt’ll make your opponents drool!
Since evolution is so cool,\nI’ll give you a cool item!\r
Come back tomorrow for\nsomething even cooler!
HORSEA: Taatuu!
