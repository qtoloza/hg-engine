Hi! I collect cute Pokémon!\nDo you have a Mime Jr.?\rWanna trade it for my Smoochum? {YESNO 0}
Wow! Thank you!\nI always wanted Mime Jr.!

You don’t want to trade?\nAww, sugar!
Your Mime Jr. is sooo cute!\nIt even evolved into a Mr. Mime!\rIs my old friend Smoochum a\nsweepin’ dancin’ Jynx yet?
This happened when I was young.\rThe sky suddenly turned black.\nA giant Flying-type Pokémon was\fblocking out the sun.\rI wonder what that Pokémon was?\rIt was like a bird and like a dragon.
Is there really a Pokémon that big?\fIf it exists, it must be powerful.
Mister, that’s not Smoochum.\nI know what Smoochum looks like!
Miss, that’s not Smoochum.\nI know what Smoochum looks like!
After the conclusion of the trade, a\nmysterious sphere appeared in midair...\r
