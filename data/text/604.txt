...\rYou again?\rThere’s no need to be alert.\nI don’t bother with wimps like you.\rSpeaking of weaklings, the city’s\nGym Leader isn’t here, and\fis supposedly taking care of a\fsick Pokémon at the Lighthouse.\rHumph! Boo-hoo!\nJust let sick Pokémon go!\rA Pokémon that can’t battle\nis worthless!\rWhy don’t you go train at\nthe Lighthouse?\rWho knows? It may make you a bit\nof a better Trainer!\r
Dark roads are dangerous at night.\rBut, in the pitch-black night,\nthe sea is even more treacherous!\rWithout the beacon of the Lighthouse\nto guide her, no ship can sail.
That thing you have--\nit’s a Pokégear, right?\fWow, that’s cool.
Wow, you have a Pokémon!\nThat is just so awesome.
You, young Trainer!\nThe sea is sweet!\rSing with me!\fThe sea is blue!\nThe sea is salty!

Olivine’s Lighthouse\rIt is also known as\nthe Glitter Lighthouse.
Boss Pokémon have been unlocked in\nRoute 38 and the Burned Tower!
Think of all the Pokémon you could get\nfrom that Safari Zone... Fufufu...
The storms around the lighthouse\nhave been different lately.\rOn clear nights, I see strange shapes\nin the clouds near the beacon.\fOne looked like a green serpent\nriding the wind.\rOld sailors call them storm spirits.\nThey’re drawn to the light.\r
You calmed that wind spirit?\nWell, the thunder’s gotten worse.\rLike something’s angry its\ncompanion was tamed.\fOr maybe... looking for you.\rBe careful if you return to\nthe lighthouse at night.\r
Both the wind and thunder spirits?\nYou’re something else, kid.\rThe skies are peaceful now.\nAlmost too peaceful...\rThe old legends say three wind\ngods exist - wind, thunder, earth.\rWhen the first two are at peace,\nthe third descends to restore\fbalance to the land itself.\r
All three forces of nature,\nmastered by a single trainer.\rThe land, sea, and sky are\nin perfect harmony now.\r
