Go, Rattata!\rTackle!\r
What? This is a big battle!\fLeave me alone!\r
A Pokémon can use its moves as long\nas the moves still have PP.\rWhen a move has no PP remaining, that\nPokémon cannot use that move.\rThen you should take your Pokémon to\nthe Pokémon Center.

I’m not a Trainer.\rBut if you look one in the eyes,\nprepare to battle.
Hey, kiddo!\rHow in the world can you be so\noblivious to my eye-catching house?\fHold it right there!\r
When you follow that path up north,\nyou will see Mr. Pokémon’s house.\rBut before you go, let me finish what\nI have to say.\rDo you...have any Apricorns?\fApricorn trees bear fruit once a day.\fI have one of those trees, too!\rApricorns are really something.\nYou can make Poké Balls and\fother things.\rThey are quite useful.\rI have a feeling this is meant to be,\nbecause I have something for you!\r
                     
With that Apricorn Box, you can carry\nso many Apricorns.\rYou’ll be a decent Apricorn collector!\r

Trainer Tips\rNo stealing other people’s Pokémon!\rPoké Balls are to be thrown only at\nwild Pokémon!
Oh! You’re wearing the Running Shoes.\rThey make you feel like you are flying,\ndon’t they?\rBut beware of wild Pokémon and\nTrainers!\rWhen you run, the noise will\nattract them.
Oh, hello. Mr. Pokémon said he was\nexpecting a young trainer to arrive...\rIs your name {STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0}, by any chance?\rI see. I guess you are the trainer\nMr. Pokémon was expecting!\rMy name is Cynthia. I’m a Pokémon\nTrainer who hails from Sinnoh.\r
Cynthia: Tell me, {STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0}, have you\nheard a story that tells the tale of\fthe Legendary Trainer?\r
Cynthia: You haven’t? I’ll briefly\nexplain. The story tells the tale of\fhow a trainer travels the lands of\fJohto and Kanto, catching all the\fPokémon known to mankind. He captures\fthe most basic of Pokémon, and even\fthe most mythical of Pokémon, to\feventually come face to face with\fthe one who the Pokémon call god...\r
Cynthia: The archaeology in the Johto\nregion appears to back the existence\fof this story. It’s interesting, to\fbe sure.\r
Cynthia: Thank you for listening to\nme, {STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0}. You know, you remind me\fof a trainer I knew from Sinnoh...\rYou may not know it yet, but I think\nyou are capable of great things.\rIn fact, I’d like to help you reach\nyour maximum potential!\rCynthia: Here, let me give you a\nsmall gift.\r
{STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0} received an Eevee!
Would you like to give\nthe Eevee a nickname? {YESNO 0}
Cynthia: The numerous possibilities of\nevolution for Eevee make it a very\finteresting Pokémon.\rI wonder what you’ll decide\nto evolve Eevee into...?\r
Cynthia: Perhaps we’ll cross paths\nagain, {STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0}, but until then, farewell!
