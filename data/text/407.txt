Well, hello!\rIt’s said that past this hole used to be\na huge tower reaching far into the sky.\rThey say that it was a rather strange\ntower with half of it embedded\fin the cliff.\rIt was not just a tall tower reaching\nup to the sky, but also reaching deep\fdown underground!\rIt is rumored that it even reached the\nbottom of the ocean!\rIn short, the ruins used to connect\nthe sky, the land, and the\fsea to each other...\rMost of the tower is now crumbled,\nand the only things that remain are\fthe entrance and its interior, where\fyou’ll see strange patterns.
I think this building may have been\nbuilt to enshrine Pokémon with\fa strong connection to the sea,\fthe land, and the sky.
A masked guy who looks great in front\nof a huge torrential waterfall...\fThat’s me, Crasher Wake!\rWho dares to talk to me so freely?\rOh!\nYou are that mask-fanatic Trainer\fI saw at the Celadon Dept. Store!\r
Wake: I heard about the great\nwaterfall near Cianwood and decided\fto come see it.\rThis waterfall is awesome!\rNo human or Pokémon can survive\nwithout water, yet that same water\fcan sometimes cause great suffering.\r
Wake: You must be a Trainer from this\nregion, right?\rI hope you’ll become a Trainer\nwith the qualities of water--\fstrong, tough to beat, yet\frefreshing.\rGood luck, mask-fanatic {STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0}!\r
Chuck: Ooomph!\nYou came all this way just to see me?\rThen you might as well take a\npicture with me, too. Yes? {YESNO 0}
Chuck: Say cheese!\nDon’t close your eyes!\r
Chuck: Great picture!\nThis wil be a good memory for you, too!
Chuck: No? You came all the way\njust to say no?

Mira: Keep going! There’s even more\nTeam Rocket members ahead!
ALAKAZAM: Kazaa!
This Team Rocket designed boulder\nrefuses to budge!
Upon inspection, the boulder cracked\nand shattered.
Buck: Aha! I was wondering when you\nwould arrive!\rWe came to help, but there’s more of\nthese Rocket goons than we can handle\falone... But, now you’re here!\rLet’s take ’em down!\r
Brats! Rats! Gnats!\r
Yaa! Master Archer won’t be happy\nwith us...
Buck: Ehehehe! That was a smoking-hot\nbattle! It’s not over yet, though!\rLemme heal your Pokémon!\r
Buck: Baoba is still in the Safari\nZone Gate. You better help him!
CLAYDOL: Cuuwaydol!
Cheryl: Ah, you must be {STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0}.\rI was told of your arrival, but I’m\nsurprised to see you so soon!\rMay we defeat these goons?\r
The Safari Zone is ours!\nYou aren’t taking it back!\r
No way! How did we get beaten?
Cheryl: Thank you for your help.\nYou have my gratitude.\rI’ll heal your Pokémon as thanks!\r
Cheryl: The Safari Zone must be saved!
BLISSEY: Buhliss!
Marley: I’ve been waiting for you...\rWe were able to hold them off...\nBut we couldn’t defeat them...\fBut now you’re here... We can.\fThat makes me happy...\rNow, we should defeat these people...\r
Some shy girl and a kid aren’t\ngoing to beat us!\r
Ayeeh! What just happened!?
Marley: Thank you... I appreciate it...\nJust a bit...\rI’ll heal your Pokémon up...\r
Marley: Bye-bye...\nYou’re almost there...
ARCANINE: Arrrrrrrrr!
Ariana: Hold it!\rYou’ve gone far enough on this heroic\njourney. Get ready for a thrashing!\r
Ariana: Tch... For a brat, you’re\nvery strong. I must inform Archer...
Marley: Were you expecting a\ndouble battle...?\rI already beat the Rockets...
Oh?\rAriana seems to have dropped\nsomething...\r
