Um...\nWho did you say I was again?\r...\n...\rOh, yes, I remember now!\nI’m the Move Deleter!\r
You’ve come to make me force your\nPokémon to forget some moves? {YESNO 0}
Which Pokémon should forget a move?\r
Remember me if there are moves that\nneed to be forgotten.
That Pokémon knows only one move,\nso it can’t be forgotten...\r
What? That’s an Egg.\nNo Egg should know any moves.\r
OK, then.\nWhich move should be forgotten?\r
Hm! The move {STRVAR_1 6, 0, 0}?\nShould that move be forgotten? {YESNO 0}
It worked perfectly!\rYour Pokémon has forgotten the move\n{STRVAR_1 6, 0, 0} completely.
Me?\nI’m the Pokémon Move Maniac.\rI know every move that Pokémon learn\nwhile they’re leveling up, and I can\fmake Pokémon remember those moves.\rI can make a Pokémon of yours remember\na move if you’d like.\rBut...ahem! It’ll cost you.\rI’ll make a Pokémon remember a move\nif you’ll trade me a Heart Scale.
Ha! That’s it! That’s an honest-to-\ngoodness Heart Scale!\rLet me guess, you want me to teach\none of your Pokémon a move?\r
If any of your Pokémon needs to learn a\nmove, come back with a Heart Scale.
Which Pokémon needs tutoring?\r
Which move should I make it remember?\r
Sorry...\rThere isn’t any move I can make\nthat Pokémon remember.
Hunh?\rDon’t you think it’d be tough for\nan Egg to remember a move?\rIt’s not even hatched.









{STRVAR_1 3, 3, 0} handed over one\nHeart Scale in exchange.
