Hey! You have a Pokédex!\nDid Professor Oak give that to you?
I got quite a shock at the Gym.\nThere were all these girls who\flooked identical.
I’m Janine! Hocus-pocus...\nPoof!\r
See? I look just like her now!\r...?\rHuh? Didn’t work?
Cloyster: Crouu!
Do you want to...\nheal your Pokémon..? {YESNO 0}
It doesn’t look like Cloyster\ncares about your response...
Shellder: Herr!
Shellder: Derr...
Slowpoke: ...Yawn?
Cloyster ignored your answer,\nlooking for a fight!\r
Woah!\nThis Cloyster looks a bit different..!\r
The not-so-lazy Pokémon fled\nthe scene after the Cloyster was\fdefeated.
