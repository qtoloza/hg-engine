People train at this Lighthouse.\rIt’s not easy to climb because of\nall the Trainers.
In the past, Pokémon used to light\nthe sea around Olivine at night.\rThe Lighthouse was made to pay tribute\nto those Pokémon.
Oh, hi! I can make you an awesome\nnecklace if you give me fifteen\fPoké Balls and one Destiny Knot!\rHow about it?
What? Really? I thought that’d be a\nsure-fire sell!
Thank you!\r...But you don’t have the items...
Thank you!\rHold on a moment...\r
Oh, crackers, it didn’t work...\rUhh... goodbye!\r
Oh, hi! I can make you an awesome\nbelt if you give me fifteen Poké Balls\fand one Destiny Knot!\rHow about it?
The woman dropped an item as she\nwas fleeing...\r
Volkner: Glitter Lighthouse... It\nreminds me a lot of Sunyshore City...\r
Volkner: Oh, hi. You must be a Trainer\nfrom Johto, huh?\rThere’s something about you... You\nremind me of a Trainer who once\frecharged my passion for battling.\rHeh. It’s a shame you aren’t\nchallenging the Sinnoh League.\rAnd yet, you’ve somehow cheered me up!\nLet me give you a gift as thanks.\r
Volkner: Thunder Wave is a simple move\nthat will paralyze whatever it can make\fcontact with.\rI should probably be off.\nIt was a pleasure to meet you!
