Hm? That’s a Pokédex, isn’t it?\nMay I see it?\rThere are so many kinds of Pokémon.\nHm? What’s this?\rWhat is this Pokémon?\nIt looks like the strange writing on the\fwalls of the ruins.\rIf those drawings are really Pokémon,\nthere should be many more.\rI know! Let me upgrade your Pokédex.\nFollow me.\r
Ouch!\r
Are you OK?\nI was in a hurry and...\fSorry, did I hurt you?\r
No way!\nCould it be a Pokémon from Sinnoh...\fThe one they call Arceus...?\r
Oh, could it be...?\nArceus causing all this...?\rI cannot explain it any other way...\r
Arceus may be the key to solving the\nmystery of the Unown and the\fRuins of Alph...?\r
Can you come to the Ruins of Alph with\nme? Please! You must!\rI am trembling with excitement.\nI think something is about to happen!\r
Ruins of Alph.\rVisitors who are interested in\narchaeology are welcome.
Ruins of Alph.\rFeel free to explore the ruins and\nbecome a fossil professor!

This is a mysterious hall.\nPlease watch your step.
The Unown aren’t the only\nmystery here.\rOur research suggests these ruins\nwere once connected to... other\fplaces. Other dimensions.\fSomething may still use those\nconnections.\rWe’ve detected spatial anomalies\nin the inner chambers.\r
The spatial readings have\nstabilized.\rDid you encounter something\nin the inner chambers?\rFascinating... simply fascinating.\r
Hoop-pa!\r
Hoopa slipped through a ring...
