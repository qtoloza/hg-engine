Where did you say you’re from?\rNew Bark Town?\rThat’s the town where...\nProfessor Elm lives, right?\fYou’ve come a long way to get here.
Oh! Are you a tourist?\rYou should take a look around\nthe wonders of Ecruteak City!\rExplore the Burned and Bell towers!\nChallenge the gym! It’s worth it!
Boss Pokémon have been unlocked in\nRoute 37 and the Ruins of Alph!

You... You wouldn’t happen to be \n{STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0}, would you?\rAh, sorry, I should introduce myself.\rMy name is Steven.\nI’m the Champion of the Hoenn Region.\rSteven: Cynthia told me about a young \ntrainer who seemed different from the \frest...\rI can see what she meant immediately.\rAhem!\rDo you remember the story about the\nLegendary Trainer that Cynthia\ftold you?\rAnother part of that story involves\nthe collection of Plates, special\fitems that resonate with the\fPokémon god.\rIt’s said there are sixteen in total,\nand they are scattered across the\fJohto and Kanto regions, as well\fas very far north.\rEach Plate represents an element,\nsuch as Fire, Water, Electric, Steel...\rThey could be found anywhere. In the\nmodern age, they’re probably either\fheld by enthusiasts, buried in the\fground, or even just picked up by\frandom people.\r
In fact, I wouldn’t be surprised if\none had ended up in the bin of a\fresearch lab...\r
How do I know these Plates exist?\nBecause I’ve already located one!\rThis is the Iron Plate, the Plate that\nrepresents the element of Steel.\rI’d like to leave it in your capable\nhands, however. It can give your\fPokémon a small boost to some of their\fmoves, too, so it’ll be helpful!\rHere. Don’t drop it!\r
You should try looking for the rest of\nthose Plates. You might even help\fprove the legend true!\rWell, it was nice meeting you--but until\nwe cross paths again, this is goodbye.
