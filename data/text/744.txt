You have to warm up before going into\nthe water.\rThat’s basic.\n
        
                         
Hey, you’re young and fit!\nDon’t ride your Pokémon! Swim!\n
      
                                 
Are you going to Cianwood?\rHow about a quick battle first?\n
        
                             
No inflatable tube for me.\nI’m hanging on to a sea Pokémon!\n
             
                               
You can’t see it from here, but there\nis a big city called Cianwood\facross the sea.
I took the ship to go to Olivine for\nsome sightseeing. I really liked\fthe atmosphere.\rBeing a port, it was nothing like\nthe big cities.
Do you know what lies just past\nthis gate?\rIt’s the Battle Frontier!\rEvery time I have a journey, I’ve\nraised mostly “useful” Pokémon.\rBut now that I am here, I think I\nshould have brought my\f“battle” Pokémon!
Hey!\nGreat waves here!\rNo one can resist such\ngood waves!\r
I see... You don’t have Surf yet...\nThis is just between you and me...\rI got Surf from a man at Ecruteak,\nand I think he’s still there.\rWhy don’t you try going there?\r

Izumi: Ah, {STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0}!\nIt has been a long time.\rIn fact, I was looking for you.\nI’ve got an Egg here that was\fwashed up on the shore,\fbut it’s a little special compared\fto other Eggs you may have seen.\rWould you be willing to take it? {YESNO 0}
Izumi: I see.\nCome back if you change your mind.
Izumi: Thank you, {STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0}!\r
{STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0} received the {COLOR 2}MANAPHY Egg{COLOR 0}!
Izumi: You should be able to take\ncare of it the same as any other\fEgg. I shall take my leave...
Izumi: Although I do want to give\nthis Egg to you...\r...Your party is full.
Izumi: Hello, again.\nDo you wish to accept the Egg? {YESNO 0}
They say schools of PHIONE\nsometimes cross the warm sea here.\rYou might encounter one if you’re\nreally lucky!\rI’d like to see one...\r
That Pokémon you have behind you!\nSigh, that’s not a PHIONE...
That Pokémon you have behind you!\r
It’s a PHIONE!\nWow, you must be lucky!\rThank you for showing me.\nPlease, take these as thanks!\r
Nobody really knows if PHIONE\ncounts as legendary or not.\rEither way, it’s still so cute!
