You came from Olivine?\rDo you remember the four islands\nalong the way?\rI heard that a mythical sea creature is\nhiding in them.
Gligar: Guraiiga!
Sneasel: Nyulaa!
Hey, kid! Isn’t Gligar the\nbest Pokémon? {YESNO 0}
You agree? Awesome. You should raise\nyour very own Gligar.\rThen use this to evolve it!\r
Equip that item to a Gligar and level it\nup at night. It should evolve into a\ffabulous Gliscor!
Hey, kid! Isn’t Sneasel the\nbest Pokémon? {YESNO 0}
You agree? Awesome. You should raise\nyour very own Sneasel.\rThen use this to evolve it!\r
Equip that item to a Sneasel and level\nit up at night. It should evolve into\fan extravagant Weavile!
You don’t think so?\rAt first, I was overjoyed to see you.\rNow, I only want you gone!
