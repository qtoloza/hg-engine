You came from Olivine?\rDo you remember the four islands\nalong the way?\rI heard that a mythical sea creature is\nhiding in them.
GLIGAR: Guraiiga!
SNEASEL: Nyulaa!
Hey, kid! Isn’t GLIGAR the\nbest Pokémon? {YESNO 0}
You agree? Awesome. You should raise\nyour very own GLIGAR.\rThen use this to evolve it!\r
Equip that item to a GLIGAR and level it\nup at night. It should evolve into a\ffabulous GLISCOR!
Hey, kid! Isn’t SNEASEL the\nbest Pokémon? {YESNO 0}
You agree? Awesome. You should raise\nyour very own SNEASEL.\rThen use this to evolve it!\r
Equip that item to a SNEASEL and level\nit up at night. It should evolve into\fan extravagant Weavile!
You don’t think so?\rAt first, I was overjoyed to see you.\rNow, I only want you gone!
