Cynthia: {STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0}! It’s good to see you\nagain. This is an in-progress base that\fis built for archaeologists, so it’s\fa good place for me to stay around!\rCynthia: You know, if you find or get\ngiven any ancient looking items, you\fshould bring them to me. I might be\fable to help decipher their meaning.
Cynthia: If you find anything\ninteresting that looks ancient,\fbring it to me. I might be able to\fshed some light on it.
Cynthia: What is this item? Professor\nOak gave it to you? Hmm...\rHe said it’s called the Lock Capsule?\rI heard this is somehow related to\nthe golems of legend...\rLet me try something a moment...
Cynthia: The capsule reacted very\nstrongly to that braille tablet\fI obtained from the Hoenn region...\rThe Lock Capsule seems to be giving off\nan aura!\rI wonder what that could mean.\rPerhaps the golems have surfaced\naround Johto?
Cynthia: Are you searching for\nREGIROCK, REGICE, and REGISTEEL?\rIt’s hard to guess, but could they’ve\nappeared within Johto’s caves?\rIt might be worth your while to take a\ndeep look inside some of them.

Uh... I hate to say it, but you\nhaven’t got enough money for that.
Cynthia: Ah, welcome back! You engaged\nwith the three golems? Intruiging...\rI wonder if we can somehow find the\nfourth golem, REGIGIGAS.\rI’ll do some research into it.\nYou should come back sometime later.
If you have any fossils on you, I can\nuse our technology to extract the DNA.\r
Ah, you don’t wish to extract this\ntime? Very well, then.
I’ll see what I can do. Give me some\ntime and come back later.
I’ve extracted a {STRVAR_1 0, 0, 0} from your\nfossil. Take good care of it.\r

You can often find these fossils if\nyou check under breakable rocks.\rTreat those Skull and Armor Fossils\nwith care, though. As far as Johto is\fconcerned, they’re one-of-a-kind!\rYou can talk to the man at the counter\nif you want to try reviving them...
Nice to see you again. Isn’t this\nplace fantastic?
Cynthia: Oh! Is this what they\ncall the {COLOR 1}Red Chain{COLOR 0}?\rThis chain may lead us to\nsomewhere very special...\rYes, I believe this will lead us\nto the {COLOR 1}Sinjoh Ruins{COLOR 0}.\rTalk to me again if you\nwant to take a look.
Cynthia: Talk to me again if\nyou want to take a look.
Cynthia: Do you want to go\nto the {COLOR 1}Sinjoh Ruins{COLOR 0}? {YESNO 0}

Before I sent out my Pokémon,\nmy heart begins to race...\rInteresting, my Pokémon in their Poké\nBalls appear to be quite happy.\rCould you be the reason?\r
