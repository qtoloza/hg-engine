I’m the Fishing Guru’s younger brother.\rYou seem to like fishing.\nAm I right, or am I right?\fPeople say I have keen eyes! {YESNO 0}
Yes, yes. Just as I thought!\rHere, fishing fan!\nTake this--it’s a Super Rod.\r
Try your hand at fishing wherever\nthere is water!\rRemember--you can catch different\nPokémon depending on what Rod you use.\rThe waters around this area are\nknown in particular for harbouring\fmany Dragon-type Pokémon.
Huh?\nMy own eyes deceived me?
