Tell me, {STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0}...\nDid you find any trace of the\fEon Pokémon I told you of previously?\r
Perhaps not...\rIf you do happen to capture it,\nI’d appreciate if you could show\fme LATIAS in person.
Oh! That Pokémon following you...\rThat definitely appears to be LATIAS.\rHm?
Perhaps not...\rIf you do happen to capture it,\nI’d appreciate if you could show\fme LATIOS in person.
This stone I excavated seems\nto be reacting to LATIAS...\rPerhaps you should take it\nto be checked by an expert.\rThere’s somebody in Goldenrod City who\nmight be fit for the job.\r
Hi!\r

I wonder if REGIGIGAS could be\nin Johto or Kanto, too.\rIt recently disappeared from the\nSnowpoint Temple in Sinnoh,\fbut definitely wasn’t captured.\rOf course, if it is around, it probably\nwon’t wake up {COLOR 1}unless REGIROCK, REGICE\fand REGISTEEL are nearby{COLOR 0}.\r
Although, it’s a mystery why\nit’d be here in the first place...

Mythology also states the existence\nof another legendary belonging to the\fSinnoh group, but little information is\fknown.\rA carving suggests the collection of\nall sixteen Plate items is necessary\fto even catch a glimpse of the\flegendary. The Plate items are said\fto naturally gravitate towards their\felements, but between the ground we\fwalk on and the people who populate\four world, they could be anywhere.\fAs such, researching this unknown\flegendary is incredibly difficult for\four scientists to manage.\r
Whether the more common Pokémon\n{COLOR 1}PHIONE{COLOR 0} can be called legendary is\funknown. There is mixed evidence, but\ffor now we choose to declare\fit as a regular Pokémon.\r

While we’re here, would you\nconsider a friendly battle? {YESNO 0}
I’m glad to hear that as being your\nanswer. It’s been a while since I’ve\fcompeted against a trainer like you,\fbut I’m sure I’ll enjoy it!\r

The Pokémon behind you isn’t\none of the ones I mentioned, I’m afraid.\rRegardless, I’ll be waiting for you to\nbring the correct one to me.
Oh, yes, that is one of the Pokémon\nI wanted you to bring.\rSo you own a {STRVAR_1 0, 1, 0}...\rIn that case, I shall gift you\nwith these!\r
