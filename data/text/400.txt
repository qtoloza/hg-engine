Mt. Mortar is like a maze inside.\fBe careful. Don’t get lost in there.
Please, wait! You don’t have the\nMineral Badge...\rThe Pokémon on this path are\nfar too treacherous for you.
Have you heard about how aggressive\nthe Pokémon living around the mountain\fhave become?\rIt’s unbelievable!
I need to conduct more research! Have\nyou heard about the advancements of\fthe Legendary Trainer mythology?\rIt’s unbelievable!
